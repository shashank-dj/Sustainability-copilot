Operational sustainability focuses on achieving performance goals
while minimizing resource consumption and environmental impact.

Key principles include improving efficiency, reducing waste,
optimizing asset life cycles, and minimizing unnecessary operational actions.

High-performance organizations balance speed, output, and sustainability
by using data-driven decision-making.

Sustainable operations often lead to cost reduction, lower emissions,
and improved resilience.
