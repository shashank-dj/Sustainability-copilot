Formula 1 sustainability metrics can be mapped to corporate ESG concepts.

Tyre degradation reflects resource consumption efficiency.
Lower degradation indicates better use of materials over time.

Longer tyre stints reduce the number of tyres required,
which lowers material usage, logistics operations, and waste generation.

Pit stop strategies represent operational interventions.
Fewer or optimized pit stops mirror lean operational practices
in manufacturing and industrial environments.

The Sustainability Performance Score in the dashboard represents
how well performance is achieved while minimizing resource use.
This concept is transferable to corporate sustainability KPIs.
