ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance.

Environmental factors include greenhouse gas emissions, energy efficiency,
resource usage, waste management, and environmental impact reduction.

Social factors focus on workforce safety, diversity and inclusion,
employee well-being, and community impact.

Governance covers corporate ethics, transparency, risk management,
regulatory compliance, and decision-making structures.

Companies use ESG metrics to measure long-term sustainability performance
and risk, beyond short-term financial outcomes.
